Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | WordCloud

🔹 Project Overview
Analyzed 8,000+ IT job postings to extract insights about hard and soft skills demanded in the job market. This dashboard helps visualize skill trends, providing actionable insights for job seekers, recruiters, and career analysts.

🔹 Objectives

Identify top hard and soft skills in IT job postings

Visualize skill frequency using word clouds and bar charts

Provide a clear overview of market demand for technical and interpersonal competencies

🔹 Dataset

File: Job Posting-IT.csv (dataset for demonstration)

Contains job titles, descriptions, company info, location, and other metadata

Uploaded in /data folder on GitHub for reproducibility

🔹 Key Features

Cleaned and processed job description text using Python and NLTK

Extracted and counted predefined hard and soft skills

Generated interactive visualizations:

Word clouds for top skills

Horizontal bar charts for top 20 hard and soft skills

Created summary tables of skill frequencies

🔹 How to Run

Clone the repository

Install required packages:

pip install pandas matplotlib wordcloud yake nltk
